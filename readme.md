# Welcome to my GitHub profile!
Hi, I'm Luca Monaco, I'm a 19 year-old student, I'm from Rome and I'm a Front-End Web Developer and Computer Engineering student.

## Take a look at my [repository](https://github.com/lumon2004/lumon2004)

### Projects
In this repository I publish my personal projects and ideas, but also some challenges and works took by [frontendmentor.io](https://frontendmentor.io), a website which provides challenges for Front-End Web Developers like me!

### Why did I create this repository?
I created because I coded my personal portfolio. You can find:
 - the code at this link right here ([portfolio code](index.html));
 - the website page at this link right here ([portfolio webpage](https://lumon2004.github.io/lumon2004/)).

### How do I use it?
I use GitHub as a free hosting website, because thanks to the feature of the environments, I activated github-pages and now I upload on it every file in this repository, that you can reach from my portfolio.
